This burger app displays a list of burgers available under a "burger menu" column. The user can click on the "devour" button next to each
item to "eat" it. The selected burger then moves into the "sold out" column. If the user clicks on the "add back to menu" button next to 
a sold out burger, it will move back to the menu column.

In addition, a user can add their own burger idea to the menu, using the form in the middle of the page. They simply type their name
suggestion into the "suggest a new burger" input line and click the "add to menu" button. Their burger is immediately added to the menu
column.

The design of the app is a tribute to Bob's Burgers, the excellent television show about the Belchers, a family who run a burger
restaurant. The initial menu includes a list of "burgers of the day" featured on various episodes.
